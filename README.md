# TF-Workspace

Welcome to the TF_workspace repository. This repository contains Terraform configuration files for learning and practical applications. It is organized into two primary sections: Terraform Basics and GCP.

## Terraform Basics
This section is designed to cover the fundamental aspects of Terraform. 
It encompasses several projects, each demonstrating a core feature of Terraform:

01-tf-hello-world: The simplest Terraform configuration.
02-local-arguments: Illustrates the usage of local values.
03-multiple-resources: Manages multiple resources.
04-random-provider: Utilization of the Random provider in Terraform.
05-variables: Introduction to Terraform variables.
06-types-of-variables: Showcases different types of variables in Terraform.
07-multiple-provider: Shows how to handle multiple providers in a Terraform configuration.
08-dependency: Illustrates implicit and explicit dependencies in Terraform.
09-output-block: Usage of output blocks in Terraform.
10-lifecycle-rules: Shows how to use lifecycle blocks in Terraform.
11-provider-versions: Describes how to specify provider versions in Terraform.
12-data-source: Showcases the use of data sources in Terraform.

## GCP
This section contains numerous projects, each showcasing different aspects of working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services using Terraform. Each folder contains a standalone project equipped with its own Terraform configuration files (main.tf, provider.tf, etc.), and state files (terraform.tfstate, terraform.tfstate.backup).

01-getting-started: An introductory guide to setting up GCP with Terraform.
02-auth-with-service-account: Demonstrates how to authenticate with GCP using a service account.
03-google-cloud-storage: Configuration for Google Cloud Storage setup.
04-google-network: Explains how to create a virtual private cloud (VPC) network on GCP.
05-google-compute-engine: Contains Terraform configuration for Google Compute Engine.
06-Google-serverless-Cloud-Run: Shows the deployment of a serverless application on Google Cloud Run.
07-Google-cloud-functions: Configuration for deploying Google Cloud Functions.
08-Google-Big-Query: Setup for Google BigQuery using Terraform.
09-Google-cloud-PubSub: Illustrates Pub/Sub setup on GCP.
10-Google-cloud-spanner: Contains Terraform configuration for Google Cloud Spanner.

## How to Use
To utilize any of these projects, navigate into the directory of the desired project, and run *terraform init* to initialize the Terraform workspace. Following that, run *terraform apply* to create the resources described in the Terraform configuration.

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create resources in your GCP account (for the GCP section), and that Terraform is installed on your machine.
