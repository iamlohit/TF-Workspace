# All HCL scripts have an extention of .tf
# Resource: This is a block. There are various types of blocks like data etc.
# local_file: This is a resource type/category. This type creates a local file and enters content into it.
# sample_res: Unique identifier for the resource or the name of the resource.  
# Inside the {} are the arguments or attributes and its value, like a key:value pair.

# Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
# selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
# so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
# you run "terraform init" in the future.

# Terraform has been successfully initialized!

# You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
# any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
# should now work.

# If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
# rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
# commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
