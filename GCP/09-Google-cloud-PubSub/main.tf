# PubSub 101:
#     When you want to decouple two systems but enable asynchronous communication between those systems.
#     It works by creating a Publisher Topic.
#     The Subscriber subscribes to the Topic.
#     Whenever we want to share information with the subscriber, we just add it to Topic and Subscribers recieve it.
